</p>

## What do I need to get started?

- Linux or Windows environment
- Docker (Community Edition)
- One or more vCenter environments \*
- About 5 minutes of free time

\* If you do not have or want to use a real vCenter environment, we offer to deploy a simulator using [vcsim](https://github.com/MacroPower/docker-vcsim).

## What do I need to do to deploy?

## Why should I use OmegaGraf over other solutions?

OmegaGraf was inspired by several other products. We thought we could build on some of their accomplishments, any create something that was more dynamic, simpler to use, and easier to maintain.
