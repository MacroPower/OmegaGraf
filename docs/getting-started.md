# Getting Started

OmegaGraf has a few dependencies that must be installed prior to use.

## Compatibility

**OmegaGraf is supported on Windows and all major Linux distributions.** Our testing is done using Ubuntu, so that will probably be the best experience.

\* _We do not currently support MacOS, but if you're up for working with the C# Docker package on MacOS, feel free to give it a try!_

## Installation

OmegaGraf has interactive [installers](https://github.com/MacroPower/OmegaGraf/tree/master/install) that can assist with installation.

## Using OmegaGraf

The installer will print an example start command. For more help on usage, see the [walkthrough](walkthrough.md).

Note: **OmegaGraf currently uses the current _working directory_ to store container data.** Please keep this in mind. If you want to change this behavior, you can supply the `--path` argument along with an absolute or relative path to store data.

For more documentation on parameters, see [parameters](parameters.md).
